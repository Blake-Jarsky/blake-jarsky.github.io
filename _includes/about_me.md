## Hello ##
I'm Blake, and I'm learning how to be a technologist. Well, a new, specific version of a technologist anyway. I've 
always been a technologist. My early tech experiences include erector sets, electronics tinkering and general 
analyses of systems. Later I got into computer building and repair, digital media production and tabular data models. 
Now I'm tackling computer programming. 

I love the web and it's ability to empower people by providing access to valuable information. With this in mind, I am 
focusing my studies on fullstack web development. I'm working a lot with javascript, because of it's necessity for front 
end scripting, as well as it's lightweight backend proficiency. I like to add es-next abilities to my toolkit as often 
as possible. Using javascript as a strongly-typed and class-based language, ie typescript / angular, is pretty neat, 
and because I don't have a classical OOP background I don't even notice any hacky bits. I'm learning that growing a 
high stack overflow score is seriously one of the coolest (and certainly hardest) things you can do as a programmer.

## This site ##
This site is built with Jekyll and hosted via GitHub pages. Source files are available <a href="https://github.com/Blake-Jarsky/blake-jarsky.github.io" target="_blank">here.</a> It is a work in 
progress. I'm planning on adding some bootstrap elements, expanding the list of links that have been helpful in my 
learning, integrating a standard contact form (github pages being static has me looking at POST-less API-based 
solutions), and some design components/techniques (like gradient borders and CSS animations). Additional near-term 
plans include switching the nav bar to a flexbox and going through it using more semantic html, to start getting it 
to a more a11y state.
