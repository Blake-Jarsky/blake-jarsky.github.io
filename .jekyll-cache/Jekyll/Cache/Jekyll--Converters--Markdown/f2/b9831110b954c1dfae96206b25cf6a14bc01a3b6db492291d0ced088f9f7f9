<h2 id="hello">Hello</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m Blake, and Iâ€™m learning how to be a technologist. Well, a new, specific version of a technologist anyway. Iâ€™ve always been a technologist. My early tech experiences include erector sets, electronics tinkering and general analyses of systems. Later I got into computer building and repair, digital media production and tabular data models. Now Iâ€™m tackling computer programming. I love the web and Iâ€™m looking to leverage it towards empowering people by providing access to quality information. Someday Iâ€™ll become proficient at writing non-web computer programs too, but for now Iâ€™m focused on web development and related tools.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m very interested in getting more experience with testing. I read a comment in one of my programming books that said the only way to know if code really works is if it passes itâ€™s tests. This makes a lot of sense to me. Iâ€™ve been learning jest and am aiming to learn how to mock various web server functionality. I have a feeling that I will spend some time in career as a test engineer.</p>

<h2 id="this-site">This site</h2>
<p>This site is built with Jekyll and hosted via GitHub pages. Source files are available <a href="https://github.com/Blake-Jarsky/blake-jarsky.github.io">here</a>. It is a work in progress. It is intended to show that I can do some stuff, but also is a sandbox for new things Iâ€™m learning. There will be some rough edges here and there. Iâ€™m planning on adding some bootstrap elements, a list of links that have been helpful in my learning, a standard contact form, and some design components/techniques (like gradient borders and CSS animations).</p>
