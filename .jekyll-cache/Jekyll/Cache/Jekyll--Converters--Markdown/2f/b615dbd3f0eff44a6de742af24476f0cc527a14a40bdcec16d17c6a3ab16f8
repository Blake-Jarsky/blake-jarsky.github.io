<h2 id="hello">Hello</h2>
<p>I’m Blake, and I’m learning how to be a technologist. Well, a new, specific version of a technologist anyway. I’ve 
always been a technologist. My early tech experiences include erector sets, electronics tinkering and general 
analyses of systems. Later I got into computer building and repair, digital media production and tabular data models. 
Now I’m tackling computer programming. I love the web and it’s ability to empower people through providing access 
to quality information.</p>

<h2 id="this-site">This site</h2>
<p>This site is built with Jekyll and hosted via GitHub pages. Source files are available <a href="https://github.com/Blake-Jarsky/blake-jarsky.github.io" target="_blank">here.</a> It is a work in 
progress. I’m planning on adding some bootstrap elements, expanding the list of links that have been helpful in my 
learning, integrating a standard contact form (github pages being static has me looking at POST-less API-based 
solutions), and some design components/techniques (like gradient borders and CSS animations).</p>
